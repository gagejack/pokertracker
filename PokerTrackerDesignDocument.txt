New Feature: Player Account Selection
---
- When adding a player, users can select an existing player from a dropdown or enter a new name.
- Once a player is added (e.g., "Gage"), their account is saved in the system and will appear in the dropdown for future sessions.
- This prevents duplicate player entries and ensures accurate all-time tracking.
- The system should store and manage a list of unique player accounts.
